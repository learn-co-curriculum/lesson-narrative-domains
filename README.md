When we think about the learning journey students take, we want to be very thoughtful about the material they encounter and how to maintain both consistency but also present new scenarios and situations that’ll challenge and test them. 

As you work through the lessons and labs in your units, think of a couple of narrative domains that you can across your labs. For example, when we cover Rails, a lot of our labs cover the domain of creating a blog and creating an Airbnb clone.  When we cover Ruby, a lot of our labs will cover a music playlist app domain or more simply, a lot of labs will deal with the domain topic of students and classes.  These  labs will build cumulatively across  various units and give a sense of consistency that’s important for online learners.

At the same time, we also include other, usually more difficult labs that cover domains students haven’t encountered before since we want them to be able to practice their coding skills across a variety of scenarios and situations.
